1.
SQL (Structured Query Language):
SQL is a standard programming language that is specifically designed to manage and manipulate relational databases. 
It allows you to perform operations such as querying data, updating data, and managing database structures.

Relational Databases:
Relational databases are a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. 
They organize data into tables, which can be linked by defining relationships between them. 
This structure is a flexible and efficient way of retrieving and manipulating data.

2.
PDO (PHP Data Objects):
PDO is a database access layer in PHP that provides a structured method of accessing multiple databases. 
It abstracts the specifics of database connections and queries, and it enables developers to switch between different databases without changing much of the code.
PDO supports advanced features like prepared statements and transactions, which enhances security and efficiency.

Prepared Statements:
Prepared statements are a feature used in database management that allows the execution of the same SQL statement repeatedly with high efficiency. 
They are very important for security, as they help prevent SQL injection attacks by separating the SQL code from the data values. 
Prepared statements ensure that user input is treated as data only, not as part of the SQL command, thus mitigating the risk of executing malicious code injected by users.
